# Module 8 Lab

***In this lab, I tackled five programming scenarios and created corresponding functions to address each problem.***

**Problem 1: Equal Check**
I implemented the IsEqual(x, y) function, allowing users to input two integers (x and y). The program determines whether these inputs are equal or not.

**Problem 2: Sum Check**
The CheckIf10(x, y) function was created to receive two user-input integers (x and y). The function then returns whether the sum of these integers is greater than, less than, or equal to 10.

**Problem 3: Finding 5 in a List**
For this problem, I devised the has_5_in_list(input_list) function. Users can input a range of numbers in the list, and the function determines if the value 5 is present.

**Problem 4: Leap Year Checker**
The Leap_year(input_year) function was developed to check if a given year is a leap year. The conditions include divisibility by 4 and specific rules for years divisible by 100 and 400.

**Problem 5: Video Game Character Functions**
I created three functions, Climb_Mountain, Cook_Meal, and Write_book, to verify if the player possesses the required items and status effects to carry out these tasks in the video game.

Feel free to explore each function to understand their implementation and use them as needed. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
